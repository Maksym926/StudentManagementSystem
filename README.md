Student Management System Description
Student
The student management system allows students to log in to their accounts or register if they do not have one. During registration, the student's data will be stored in the database. Once authenticated, students will have access to study materials (courses). Each course includes assignments that students must complete and submit as ZIP files. After submission, the system will store the completed assignments in the database.

Teacher
Teachers have access only to their assigned courses and cannot view other teachers' courses. For example, a Math teacher may have access to Geometry or Algebra courses but not others. Within their assigned courses, teachers can add assignments for students. Once students submit their assignments, teachers can download and grade them. The assigned grades will be stored in the database and displayed in the students' accounts.
